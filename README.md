 using human cell records,our aim is to classify cells to whether the samples are benign (mild state) or malignant (evil state)
our goal is to determine the cell characteristics by which we can identifiy malignant cells by using a software for predicition instead of taking a sample from the tumer

**analysis**

Using several machine learning techniques along with the auto tuning technique using the grid search library we are trying to  predict a tumor to be evil or mild 

####To run the code install jupiter notebook from anaconda using conda or pip You also need to install the following libraries: pandas,numpy,matplolib,SKicit-learn
